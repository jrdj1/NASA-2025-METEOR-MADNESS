# 01 – Challenge Context

## 1. Introduction

Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) — asteroids and comets whose orbits bring them close to Earth — represent one of the most unpredictable and potentially devastating natural threats to our planet. Although catastrophic impacts are statistically rare, their consequences can be global, ranging from regional devastation to long-term climatic disruption. 

NASA’s **Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO)** and the **Near-Earth Object (NEO) Program** continuously monitor and catalog these celestial bodies using telescopic observations, radar data, and orbit determination algorithms. Through its public **NASA NEO API**, vast datasets are made available to scientists, developers, and educators, providing detailed parameters such as size, orbit type, velocity, and approach distance.

Simultaneously, the **U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)** collects and curates terrestrial datasets that are fundamental for understanding how an asteroid impact would interact with Earth's systems — including topographic elevation, seismic zones, and coastal vulnerability to tsunamis. These datasets are essential for modeling secondary effects like seismic waves, atmospheric disturbances, and oceanic propagation after an impact.

## 2. Problem Context

Despite the availability of high-quality open data, these resources are often **siloed** across different institutions and formats. Most existing tools focus either on **detection and tracking** of asteroids (orbital mechanics) or on **isolated impact analyses**, without offering an integrated, interactive platform capable of combining space and Earth data into a coherent simulation.

This fragmentation limits both **scientific understanding** and **public engagement**. Scientists may have access to complex data but lack intuitive visualization interfaces, while policymakers and educators often lack tools to interpret the data meaningfully. As a result, decision-making and public preparedness remain suboptimal in the face of potential asteroid threats.

## 3. Challenge Motivation

The **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 – "Meteor Madness"** invites teams to address this data-integration and visualization gap. The challenge calls for the creation of a **web-based simulation and visualization tool** that leverages real NASA and USGS datasets to:

- Model asteroid trajectories and impact scenarios using physical and orbital principles.
- Predict potential environmental and geological consequences (crater formation, shockwaves, tsunamis, atmospheric effects).
- Evaluate mitigation strategies such as kinetic deflection or gravitational tractors.
- Present all information through **accessible, dynamic visual interfaces** designed for experts and the general public alike.

The ultimate goal is to transform complex scientific data into **actionable, educational, and visually compelling insights** that enhance understanding of asteroid impact phenomena and the importance of planetary defense.

## 4. Relevance and Global Importance

Planetary defense is not merely an astronomical concern but a multidisciplinary endeavor that combines physics, data science, geoscience, and communication. Developing public-friendly, scientifically grounded tools contributes directly to the goals of the **United Nations’ “Space 2030” Agenda** and NASA’s own mission to “protect our planet and improve life on Earth.”

By addressing this challenge, participants not only contribute to scientific literacy and emergency preparedness but also help build bridges between **space research**, **data visualization**, and **global risk management**.
