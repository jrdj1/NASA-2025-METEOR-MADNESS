# 07 – Business Model

## 1. Overview

The **Meteor Madness** project, though scientific and educational in nature, includes a strategic business model to ensure its long-term sustainability and scalability.  
The proposed model combines open access for educational and research use with value-added services for institutions, organizations, and agencies interested in planetary defense simulation and data integration.

The business strategy focuses on three pillars: **education**, **scientific collaboration**, and **decision-support services**.

## 2. Value Proposition

The platform bridges the gap between complex planetary defense data and public understanding, providing value to multiple sectors:

| Target Group | Value Provided |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Educational Institutions** | Interactive tool for teaching astronomy, physics, and Earth sciences. |
| **Research Centers** | Open API for integrating simulation modules and testing models. |
| **Government & Policy Makers** | Decision-support platform for risk assessment and preparedness. |
| **General Public** | Engaging experience to raise awareness about asteroid impact risks. |

This combination of accessibility and professional utility positions Meteor Madness as both a **learning resource** and a **scientific service**.

## 5. Cost Structure

| Category | Examples |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Infrastructure** | Cloud hosting (AWS, GCP), data storage, CDN costs. |
| **Development** | Software engineering, testing, and continuous updates. |
| **Data Management** | API calls, dataset acquisition, version control. |
| **Educational Materials** | Content creation, translations, and gamification design. |
| **Marketing and Outreach** | Promotion through social networks, educational events, and conferences. |

---

## 6. Sustainability Strategy

Meteor Madness aims for a **hybrid sustainability model** based on open science and community-driven support:
- Maintain the core platform under an **open-source license** (MIT or Apache 2.0).  
- Foster a community of contributors (developers, educators, researchers).  
- Secure recurring grants from educational and scientific institutions.  
- Promote collaborative innovation through hackathons and open challenges.  

---

## 7. Impact Potential

By merging education, open data, and public engagement, Meteor Madness can evolve into a **global platform for planetary risk awareness**.  
Its business model prioritizes **sustainability through collaboration**, ensuring that knowledge and preparedness against asteroid impacts remain accessible to all.

---

## 8. Summary

The business model behind **Meteor Madness** supports a sustainable balance between openness, education, and operational viability.  
Through a combination of grants, institutional partnerships, and community involvement, the project ensures long-term scalability while remaining aligned with NASA’s principles of open science and global awareness.
