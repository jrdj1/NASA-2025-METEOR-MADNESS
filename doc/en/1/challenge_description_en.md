# üöÄ NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 ‚Äì Meteor Madness

## 1. Title and Context
**Challenge Name:** Meteor Madness  
**Event:** NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025  
**Categories:** Astrophysics, Data Visualization, Disaster Response, Planetary Defense  

A newly identified near-Earth asteroid, *Impactor-2025*, presents a potential threat to Earth. The challenge invites participants to develop a scientifically grounded, interactive tool that integrates NASA and USGS datasets to simulate, visualize, and analyze asteroid impact scenarios and mitigation strategies.

## 2. Summary
The discovery of *Impactor-2025* highlights the persistent risk of asteroid collisions with Earth. While NASA‚Äôs Near-Earth Object (NEO) program provides detailed asteroid orbital and physical data through the **NASA NEO API**, and the **U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)** offers critical geophysical and environmental datasets (e.g., topography, seismic activity, tsunami risk zones), these data sources remain siloed.  
The challenge is to **integrate these heterogeneous datasets** into an interactive simulation platform that models asteroid impacts, estimates physical and environmental consequences, and visualizes potential mitigation outcomes in an accessible, technically rigorous format.

## 3. Objectives

### 3.1 General Objective
Develop an **interactive web-based visualization and simulation tool** that leverages NASA and USGS data to model, predict, and mitigate asteroid impact scenarios on Earth.

### 3.2 Specific Objectives
1. **Data Integration:** Connect and combine real datasets from NASA‚Äôs **NEO API** (asteroid parameters: size, velocity, orbit) and USGS (topographic, seismic, and hydrological layers).  
2. **Impact Simulation:** Model the asteroid‚Äôs trajectory using **Keplerian orbital mechanics** and calculate energy release based on mass and velocity.  
3. **Environmental Modeling:** Estimate secondary effects (tsunamis, seismic activity, atmospheric perturbations) using USGS data.  
4. **Visualization:** Implement **interactive 2D/3D visualizations** of impact zones, crater formation, and mitigation results using libraries like **Three.js** and **D3.js**.  
5. **Accessibility and Education:** Ensure the tool is usable by scientists, educators, and the public, integrating explanatory overlays or tooltips to clarify technical parameters.

## 4. Methodological and Technical Considerations

### 4.1 General Guidance
- **Target Audience:** Scientists, policymakers, educators, and the general public. Maintain accessibility without compromising technical precision.  
- **Scalability:** Design a modular structure capable of integrating additional datasets (e.g., atmospheric density, population exposure).  
- **Performance:** Optimize computational efficiency for real-time visualization and browser-based rendering.  

### 4.2 Scientific Considerations
- **Orbital Mechanics:** Compute asteroid motion using standard Keplerian elements: semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, and true anomaly.  
- **Impact Energy:** Derive energy via `E = ¬Ω¬∑m¬∑v¬≤`, assuming asteroid density ‚âà 3000‚ÄØkg/m¬≥. Convert to TNT equivalent for interpretation.  
- **Crater Scaling:** Use established scaling relationships to determine crater size and depth from impact energy.  
- **Environmental Effects:** Model tsunamis using coastal elevation data, and seismic propagation using geological data layers.  

### 4.3 Technical Considerations
- **Backend Processing:** Recommended languages: Python (Flask/Django). Handle API calls, physics calculations, and data parsing.  
- **Frontend Visualization:** Implement real-time graphics with **Three.js** (3D orbital paths) and **D3.js** (2D data visualization).  
- **User Interaction:** Include parameter controls (sliders, selectors) for asteroid properties and mitigation options.  
- **Error Handling:** Provide fallback datasets or simulations in case of API downtime.
