# üöÄ NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025: Meteor Madness
## üéØ Challenge Objectives

The **Meteor Madness** challenge aims to develop an interactive and educational tool that allows users to understand, simulate, and mitigate the potential effects of an asteroid impact on Earth. Using real data from **NASA** and the **USGS**, the goal is to make science accessible to the public, support informed decision-making, and raise awareness of planetary defense strategies.

## üåç General Objective
Develop an **interactive web-based platform** that enables users to:
- Explore asteroid impact scenarios.  
- Predict environmental and geological consequences.  
- Evaluate mitigation and planetary defense strategies.  
- Translate complex scientific data into accessible visual information.  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Specific Objectives

### 1. Integrate Real Scientific Data
- Connect to the **NASA NEO API** to obtain asteroid parameters such as size, mass, velocity, and trajectory.  
- Incorporate **USGS** datasets on topography, seismic activity, and coastal tsunami zones.  
- Combine these datasets into a unified structure to support realistic simulations.  

---

### 2. Simulate Realistic Physical Impact Scenarios
- Compute **kinetic energy** from asteroid mass and velocity.  
- Estimate **crater size**, **seismic magnitude**, and secondary effects (e.g., tsunamis, fires, atmospheric changes).  
- Allow users to modify key parameters like impact angle, density, or location and observe the results in real time.  

---

### 3. Visualize Results Intuitively
- Create **3D visualizations** of asteroid orbits using *Three.js* or *D3.js*.  
- Display **interactive maps** showing affected areas, seismic zones, and potential evacuation routes.  
- Include dynamic animations and adjustable sliders for simulation control.  

---

### 4. Include Defense and Mitigation Strategies
- Simulate **deflection or mitigation methods**, such as:  
  - Kinetic impactors.  
  - Gravity tractors.  
  - Laser ablation.  
- Visualize how these strategies alter the asteroid‚Äôs trajectory and reduce impact risk.  
- Enable users to experiment with parameters to understand the complexity of planetary defense.  

---

### 5. Educate and Raise Public Awareness
- Design an interface accessible to scientists, students, and the general public.  
- Integrate **visual explanations** (tooltips, infographics, glossaries) to clarify complex terms like *orbital eccentricity* or *impact energy*.  
- Implement **gamified features** (‚ÄúDefend Earth!‚Äù mode) to encourage active learning.  

---

### 6. Support Informed Decision-Making
- Help **policymakers** and emergency planners understand impact scenarios.  
- Provide **regional risk maps** and damage projections to guide prevention and response policies.  
- Serve as an **educational and scientific communication tool** linking research and action.  

---

### 7. Ensure Accessibility, Accuracy, and Scalability
- Balance **scientific rigor** with **usability and clarity**.  
- Optimize for performance across devices, including mobile browsers.  
- Use a modular architecture to add new data sources (e.g., population, atmosphere) in future expansions.
