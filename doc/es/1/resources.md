NASA Data & Resources

NASA Near-Earth Object (NEO) Web Service Application Programming Interface (API): This API provides access to NASA’s Near-Earth Object (NEO) dataset, including orbital parameters (e.g., semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination), size estimates, and close-approach data for asteroids and comets. Participants can use this data to model the trajectory of a hypothetical asteroid like Impactor-2025, calculate potential impact probabilities, and simulate deflection strategies. The API is publicly accessible with a free key (directions to generate a key are on the above website), making it ideal for real-time data integration into web-based tools. It’s particularly useful for generating realistic orbital paths and impact scenarios. After visiting the above API link, scroll down and open the “Asteroids - NeoWs” section for more information on how to use the API.

U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) Earthquake Catalog
: The USGS NEIC provides a comprehensive, publicly accessible catalog of global earthquake data, including location, magnitude, and depth. Participants can use this dataset to model seismic effects of an asteroid impact by correlating impact energy with equivalent earthquake magnitudes. The data can also inform visualizations of ground shaking or secondary effects in specific regions, enhancing the ability to depict realistic environmental consequences. The dataset’s open access and global coverage make it valuable for international teams. Learn more about USGS Catalog Event Terms here

USGS National Map Elevation Data
: This dataset offers high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) for the United States and some global regions, available through the USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. Participants can use elevation data to model tsunami inundation or crater formation in specific impact locations, enhancing visualizations of environmental impacts. The data is publicly available, downloadable in formats like GeoTIFF, and suitable for integration into Geographic Information System (GIS)-based or 3D visualization tools, making it essential for simulating localized geological effects of an asteroid strike.

USGS National Map Training Videos
: The National Map Training page from the U.S. Geological Survey offers a rich collection of instructional videos designed to help users understand and utilize The National Map (TNM) products and services. These resources are tailored for geospatial professionals, scientists, and the general public.

Approximate Positions of the Planets: This NASA resource provides Keplerian orbital parameters for planets in our solar system and formulas for calculating their positions. While focused on planets, the Keplerian parameters (e.g., semi-major axis, eccentricity) are applicable to asteroid orbit modeling. Participants can use this resource as a reference to understand orbital mechanics and adapt the principles to simulate the trajectory of Impactor-2025 or other asteroids, making it a foundational resource for accurate orbital visualizations.

Small-Body Database Query Tool: NASA’s Small-Body Database Query tool provides access to Keplerian parameters for near-Earth objects (NEOs), including potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs). Participants can query specific asteroid data (e.g., size, orbit, velocity) to model the trajectory and impact scenarios for Impactor-25 and other asteroids. This publicly accessible database is critical for obtaining real asteroid data, enabling realistic simulations and visualizations in the challenge. Other Small-Body Database Tools may also be useful

Near-Earth Comets - Orbital Elements API: This NASA Open Data Portal API provides Keplerian orbital elements for 170 near-Earth comets (NECs) in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. While focused on comets, the orbital parameters are similar to those for asteroids, making it a useful resource for participants to practice retrieving and processing orbital data. It supports the development of orbital propagators for Impactor-2025, enhancing the ability to simulate trajectories.

Elliptical Orbit Simulator
: This NASA tutorial explains how to simulate and plot elliptical orbits using Keplerian parameters, with examples in R. Participants with intermediate coding skills can reuse or port the orbital propagator code to model the paths of Impactor-2025 or other asteroids. The tutorial is publicly accessible and provides a clear starting point for trajectory simulations, with a reminder to cite the source if used.

Eyes on Asteroids - NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL): This NASA/JPL static orrery visualizes orbital trajectories and labeled asteroids in 3D. Participants can study its design to create similar visualizations for Impactor-2025 and other asteroids, focusing on user-friendly displays of asteroid paths and impact risks. The public accessibility and focus on asteroids make it a valuable reference for interactive visualization ideas.
